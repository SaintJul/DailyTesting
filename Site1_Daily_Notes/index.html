                <p>I've began making drastic improvements with my programming. Alot more concepts have
                    pieced themselves together. All I have to do is stay consistant.
                    I've already choosen my path and I must adhire to it at all costs.
                    This will honestly be a tough journey but I truely believe that I've been well
                    equipt to undertake any of its challenges.
